# HyperSim
LED-Simulator for hyperion and open pixel protocol.

This is a python/TK app that can load a [hyperion](https://github.com/tvdzwan/hyperion) config file
or [open-pixel-control/OPC](http://openpixelcontrol.org/) layout file and visualize the LED configuration.
In addition it opens a OPC server where you can feed the virtual LEDs with real color from hyperion/opc client.

Hyperion users have to use the fadecandy driver.
